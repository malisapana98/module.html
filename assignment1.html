    <h4>Q-2 What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h4>
            <p> ➢ HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page.

                HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML
                elements. They are always specified in the start tag and usually
                come in name/value pairs like: name="value".</p>

            <p>➢ Void elements are elements in HTML that cannot have any
                child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes). Void elements
                only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void
                elements.</p>
            <h4>Q-4 What are HTML Entities?</h4>

                1. Ordered list or Number list.
                2. Unordered list or bullet list.
                3. Description list or definition list.</p>
            <h4>Q-6 What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?</h4>
            <p>➢ The class attribute is used to specify one or more class names
                for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a
                class in a style sheet.</p>
            <h4>Q-7 What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the
                ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements?</h4>
            <p> ➢ The id and class attributes are used to specify the style and
                behavior of HTML elements, but they have different purposes
                and behaviors:
                1.Id Attribute: The id attribute is used to identify a unique
                HTML element on a web page. It should be unique within the
                entire HTML document. The id attribute is often used in
                JavaScript and CSS to style and manipulate specific HTML
                elements. For example, you might use an id attribute to identify
                a specific section of a webpage that you want to highlight with a
                particular color or font size. An id attribute can be used only
                once within a single HTML document.
                2.Class Attribute: The class attribute is used to specify a group
                of HTML elements that share the same style or behavior.
                Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value, and
                a single HTML element can have multiple class values. The
                class attribute is often used in CSS to apply styles to groups of
                HTML elements. For example, you might use a class attribute to
                specify a set of links that all share the same background color or
                font size.</p>
            <h4>Q-8 What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h4>
            <p> ➢ There are several formatting tags in HTML. Some of the
                most commonly used formatting tags are:
                b [tag is for bold text]
                em [tag is for italicized text]
                u [tag is for underlined text]
                sup [tag is for superscript text]
                sub [tag is for subscript text]</p>
            <h4>Q-9 How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</h4>
            <p>➢ Cell padding is the space between the cell content and its
                border. It is defined using the cellpadding attribute of the tag.
                Cell spacing is the space between two adjacent cells in a table. It
                is defined using the cellspacing attribute of thetag.</p>
            <h4>Q-10 How can we club two or more rows or columns into a
            single row or column in an HTML table?</h4>
       
        <p> ➢You can merge two or more rows or columns into a single
            row or column in an HTML table by using the rowspan and
            colspan attributes.
            1.The rowspan attribute is used to merge or combine the number
            of cells in a row.

            • What is the difference between a block-level element and

                link redirects the user to another Web page or a document 
                or image. Live links are also placed into email, allowing 
                recipients of the message to immediately go to a website or 
                open an attached document or image.
                The default color for normal and active links is blue. Some 
                browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is 
                placed over that link; Others recognize active links when the 
                link has the focus. Those that don't have a mouse cursor over 
                that link is considered a normal link.</p>

               <h4>Q-18  What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h4>
                
                <p>➢ The main difference between HTML and XHTML is that 
                XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of HTML. 
                XHTML is based on XML, which means that it has a stricter 
                syntax compared to HTML.
                XHTML requires that all tags be closed properly and that all 
                elements be nested correctly.</p>

               <p> ➢ Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better 
                visibility and understanding of the text by the user on the 
                web page. However, both tags differ from each other as 
                suggested by their names. Logical tags are used to tell the 
                browser what kind of text is written inside the tags</p>
